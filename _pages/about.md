I am a Ph.D. Candidate'21 in the Department of ECE at Rutgers University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Sheng Wei and work with our collaborators and colleagues. My research has been focused on: 
- `Protecting program/data confidentiality and integrity` by leveraging hardware isolation techniques (e.g., ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX) on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous systems.
- `Partitioning programs` to minimize the trusted computing base in the hardware isolation-based platforms. 

In particular, I am interested in offloading/partitioning compute-intensive applications (e.g., DNN execution) in mobile/IoT devices with security/privacy properties onto accelerators (e.g., FPGA) in edge/cloud platforms. I am also interested in applying the security techniques to support confidential computations in healthcare systems.

Here is my professional summary: 
- 12 peer-reviewed publications
- 2.5-year teaching experience and 2 mentoring experiences
- Selected awards
  - `Best Paper Award` in “Test, Verification, and Security” Track, IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD), October 2016.
  - `Best Paper Nomination`, IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST), May 2018.
  - `Samsung Breakthroughs That Matter Award`, MIT Hacking Medicine Grand Hack, May 2019. (media coverage: Bloomberg, Samsung Business Insights, etc.)
- 13 presentations
- Reviewer for 5 conferences/journals
