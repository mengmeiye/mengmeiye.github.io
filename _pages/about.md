I am a Ph.D. Candidate'21 in the Department of ECE at Rutgers University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Sheng Wei and work with our collaborators and colleagues. My research has been focused on: 
- <b>Protecting programs/data confidentiality and integrity</b> by leveraging hardware isolation techniques (e.g., ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX) on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous systems.
- <b>Partitioning programs</b> to minimize the trusted computing base in the hardware isolation-based platforms. 

In particular, I am interested in offloading/partitioning compute-intensive applications (e.g., DNN execution) in mobile/IoT devices with security/privacy properties onto accelerators (e.g., FPGA) in edge/cloud platforms. I am also interested in applying the security techniques to support confidential computations in healthcare systems.
